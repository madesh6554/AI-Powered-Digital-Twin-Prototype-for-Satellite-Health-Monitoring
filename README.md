# AI-Powered Digital Twin Prototype for Satellite Health Monitoring

## Overview

This project is an **AI-powered Digital Twin Prototype** designed for **Satellite Health Monitoring**. It leverages advanced AI models, real-time data processing, and visualization techniques to assess the health status of satellites and provide predictive insights to prevent system failures.

## Features

- **Real-time Satellite Health Monitoring**
- **Predictive Analytics** for anomaly detection
- **Interactive Dashboard** (built with Streamlit)
- **Automated Alert System**
- **Visualization of Satellite Metrics**



## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/satellite-health-monitoring.git
   cd satellite-health-monitoring
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit Dashboard:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

- Launch the dashboard using Streamlit.
- View **real-time telemetry data** and **health status** of satellites.
- Receive **alerts** if anomalies are detected.
- Access the **Digital Twin** simulation for in-depth analysis.

## Improvement

- Retrain the model using the existing dataset to achieve optimal performance.
- Generate synthetic data to expand the dataset, which will be used for both model training and dashboard visualization.
- Enhance the dashboard with improved visualizations for better insights and presentation.
- Connect the dashboard to MySQL for real-time data access and updates.
